Project Specification – Sanitary Platform for Architects
1. General Objective

Create a web platform that allows architects to:

Upload their 2D/3D house plans.

Receive automatic quotes based on sanitary products present in the plan.

Visualize and interact with the plans in 3D using real materials and products.

Select alternatives directly on the plan and update the quote in real time.

Allow clients to visualize the final result and let architects customize products before generating the final quote.

2. Users

Architects

Upload 2D/3D plans.

Select products and alternatives directly on the plan.

Visualize the dynamic 3D plan.

Generate and modify quotes in real time.

Suppliers / Sanitary Companies

Upload product database (reference, price, design, materials, color, dimensions).

Continuous update of products.

Clients (optional)

Interactive 3D visualization with real materials and finishes.

3. Main Features
3.1 Plan Upload and Recognition

Supported formats: 2D (DWG, DXF) and 3D (OBJ, FBX, STL).

Automatic recognition of sanitary products in the plan.

Extract dimensions and exact location for each product.

3.2 Direct Selection on Plan

Click on a product in the 3D plan → display similar alternatives (shape, color, design).

Product modification → automatic update on 3D plan.

Track change history for reference.

3.3 Dynamic Quote

Quote generated based on detected products and available alternatives.

Updates automatically when architect changes a product.

Products can be removed if the client does not want them.

Final quote includes: reference, price, image, material.

3.4 Interactive 3D for Clients

Display real materials for each product.

Real-time visualization of the complete plan.

Rotate or explore the house interactively.

3.5 Advanced Options

Budget scenarios (low cost → premium) → automatic update of products and quote.

Filter by style, brand, or material.

Automatic suggestions of similar products to optimize design and cost.

4. Technical Architecture
4.1 Front-end

Framework: React / Vue / Angular.

3D rendering: Three.js / Babylon.js.

Direct interaction on plan (click, drag & drop, live update).

4.2 Back-end

Framework: Node.js / Django / Laravel.

RESTful API to manage products, plans, and quotes.

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (store products, plans, users).

Product recognition and quote calculation algorithms.

4.3 3D & Quote Integration

Plan analysis → product detection → initial quote generation.

Dynamic updates based on changes on the 3D plan.

4.4 Security

Architect/supplier authentication.

Access permissions and role management.

Backup of plans and quotes.

5. User Workflow

Architect creates an account → uploads plan.

Platform analyzes the plan → detects products → generates initial quote.

Architect clicks on products → selects alternatives → 3D plan updates in real time.

Dynamic quote updates automatically.

Architect validates or modifies products → final quote generated.

Client can view 3D plan and approve choices.

6. Deliverables

Fully functional 2D/3D web platform.

Product database with full CRUD capabilities.

Dynamic quote module.

User interface UX/UI for architects and suppliers.

Technical and user documentation.
